# The-Billion-Dollar-Failure-to-Fix-Indian-Undernutrition
Implemented machine learning-based inverse probability weighting and backdoor adjustment tools to investigate the effect of India's premier child supplemental nutrition program (ICDS) on nutritional status. Found no evidence of positive average causal effect on childhood nutritional outcomes.
Here is a paper I wrote about the surprisingly little evidence that ICDS, India's premier supplemental nutritional program, actually works. The data is 
from the National Family Health Survey. I implemened some machine learning tools to perform inverse probabiltiy weighting and backdoor adjustment with 
differing variations. The paper is probably more interesting to read than my code (and better organized).
